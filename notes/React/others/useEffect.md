If you try to select html element in a React component like this:

```javascript
el = document.getElementById('customPaymentSchedule')
```

`el` will be `null`.

But if you put the code into `useEffect`, if works. 

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  el = document.getElementById('customPaymentSchedule')
}, [])	
```



> If you’re familiar with React class lifecycle methods, you can think of `useEffect` Hook as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` combined.

**What does `useEffect` do?** By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function you passed (we’ll refer to it as our “effect”), and call it later after performing the DOM updates. In this effect, we set the document title, but we could also perform data fetching or call some other imperative API.

**Why is `useEffect` called inside a component?** Placing `useEffect` inside the component lets us access the `count` state variable (or any props) right from the effect. We don’t need a special API to read it — it’s already in the function scope. Hooks embrace JavaScript closures and avoid introducing React-specific APIs where JavaScript already provides a solution.

**Does `useEffect` run after every render?** Yes! By default, it runs both after the first render *and* after every update. (We will later talk about [how to customize this](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html#tip-optimizing-performance-by-skipping-effects).) Instead of thinking in terms of “mounting” and “updating”, ***you might find it easier to think that effects happen “after render”. React guarantees the DOM has been updated by the time it runs the effects.***

so this is why it works.



useEffect's dependency has to be some value, when being mutated, will rerender the component. For example, an object outside the component's scope won't work. Same reason applies to object inside the component, which will only trigger useEffect at first render.
